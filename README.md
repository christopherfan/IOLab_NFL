Project Name: Fantasy Football Advisor

Project Description: Fantasy Football Advisor is a Recommendation System that suggests the best playing team composition for a given week. The recommendation is based on a statistical matchup analysis between the players of the user's roster and the opponent to team would face that week. Based on the analysis, a player may be retained on the squad and benched, made to play or dropped from the team. If dropped, a suitable player from the pool of available players will be recommended. The user can view graphical representations to compare two players which justify the System's justification for a recommendation made.
